## Game Listing

A simple app that lists casino games using some testdata served from a json file. A couple of filter options added to filter the results.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


### Setup

simply clone the app or download the zip file and extract. In the project folder run `npm install`. Once complete run `npm start` to
start the app, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
